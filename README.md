The results that we presented along my work were obtained by python. As simulations are heavy and we needed running many of them, we had to run our code in the Altamira supercomputer. In this repository, I include the main Python files that I used.
Probably, if you try to run them, you will find problems about the paths trying to load files .dat or save figures and other files .dat.
